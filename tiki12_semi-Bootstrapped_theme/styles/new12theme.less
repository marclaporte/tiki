// This file and the files below are to partially implement the Bootstrap CSS framework in version 12 of Tiki Wiki
// CMS Groupware. The Bootstrap package needs to be in the vendor directory just as in the trunk/Tiki 13 version. To make a
// new theme, copy these files and replace "new12theme" with the theme name. The file "layout/tiki12.less" is meant to be imported
// as an unedited base file, similar to design.css, which it replaces. It contains rules from design.css but omits redundant or
// obsolete rules from design.css. Edit the variables in "custom-variables.less" (which is a copy of the default Bootstrap
// "variables.less" file - unused variables are commented out) and add rules in custom-other.less to create the new theme's design.
// This is a work in progress. Visit http://themes.tiki.org for more information.
